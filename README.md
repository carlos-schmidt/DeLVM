Training general-purpose vision models on purely sequential visual data, eschewing linguistic inputs, has heralded a new frontier in visual understanding. These models are intended to not only comprehend but also seamlessly transit to out-of-domain tasks.
However, current endeavors are hamstrung by an over-reliance on colossal models, exemplified by models with upwards of 3B parameters, and the necessity for an extensive corpus of visual data, often comprising a staggering 400B tokens. 
In this paper, we delve into the development of an efficient, autoregression-based vision model, innovatively architected to operate on a limited dataset. We meticulously demonstrate how this model achieves proficiency in a spectrum of visual tasks spanning both high-level and low-level semantic understanding during the testing phase. Our empirical evaluations underscore the model's agility in adapting to various tasks, heralding a significant reduction in the parameter footprint, and a marked decrease in training data requirements, thereby paving the way for more sustainable and accessible advancements in the field of generalist vision models.

#### TODO List

#### Set up
```
based on InternLM-v0.2.1dev20231121
```


Install: `https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM/blob/v0.2.1dev20231121/doc/en/install.md`

Put your training data to `/path/to/data/vision`.

Training command:
`torchrun --nproc_per_node 8 train.py --config ./configs/pretrain_300m.py --launcher torch`

Training via KD command:
`torchrun --nproc_per_node 8 train.py --config ./configs/kd_1b_to_300m.py --launcher torch`

Convert model and inference example: `./tools`

The corresponding huggingface ckpt can be downloaded at [LLaMA-1b-hf Onedrive](https://unisyd-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/han_wu_sydney_edu_au/EQx8q3DvqP1CqOddm0aYN4wBBywVAOSvyB1P12ItzuNDmw?e=uOkUnP) / [LLaMA-1b-hf Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/12oI_TOVHtbhriM1Bu1TXmw?pwd=1234) and [LLaMA-300m-hf](https://github.com/ggjy/DeLVM/releases/download/hf-ckpt/llama_300m_hf.zip).
